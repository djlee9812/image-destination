# image-destination (Travel Match)
This is Travel Match, our project for HackMIT 2017.

Put in a link to, or upload a JPEG, PNG, GIF, or BNP file and click "Analyze Image" in order to get relevant listings on potential vacation destination recommendations. 

The software uses the Microsoft Azure Computer Vision API for image recognition and the Amadeus API for retrieving current airfare prices.

The website is now hosted on Github's servers at:
